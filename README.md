# Life Quest Tracker

A new Flutter project I started with help from AI so i can learn more or less the basics of Dart. Now that I understand some concepts, even though
the learning curve seems very steep, I will start to build a more definitive program with Java, and after that I will proceed with Flutter again and 
create a complete multi-platform App.
